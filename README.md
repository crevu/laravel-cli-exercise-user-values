## Disclaimer

This application is meant to be an exercise, I tried to make it clean but of course some parts are not 100% complete,
for example the tests. I wrote a unit test and an integration test. The integration basically tests integration
between multiple classes, but in a normal application there other types of tests as well. Also the test coverage is small
since it would require more time invested and I think what I did is enough to show my skills regarding this.
